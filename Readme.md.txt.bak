Understood — no Kotlin, no irrelevant languages.
Here is a **clean, GitHub-ready `README.md`** written specifically for your **Python-only AFL Fantasy 2026 data pipeline**.

# **AFL Fantasy 2026 – Data Pipeline**

This repository contains the full automated workflow for generating **AFL Fantasy player projections** and **ceiling projections** for the 2026 AFL season.
All components are written in **Python**, and the pipeline processes raw DFS and FootyWire data into **round-by-round player projections**.

# **🚀 End-to-End Workflow**

This section documents the exact steps to generate all projection files.

---

## **1. `fetch_dfs_data.py` – Download DFS Australia Fantasy Data**

**Output Directory**

```
C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\dfs
```

**Creates**

* `afl_results_{season}.xlsx`
* `afl_fantasy_points_{season}_{team}.xlsx`

**Purpose**

* Scrapes DFS Australia for:

  * Fixture & results
  * Fantasy points for every player in every round
* Produces source data used for averages and ceiling calculations.

---

## **2. `build_player_summary.py` – Player vs Opponent Averages**

**Output File**

```
data/raw/afl_fantasy_player_summary.xlsx
```

**Reads Input Files**

```
data/dfs/afl_fantasy_points_*.xlsx
```

**Purpose**

* For each player, compute **average score vs each AFL team**.
* Produces the dataset used for base (average) projections.

---

## **3. `build_fixture_2026.py` – Download 2026 Fixture**

**Output File**

```
data/raw/fixture_2026.xlsx
```

**Purpose**

* Scrapes FootyWire to fetch the full 2026 AFL fixture.
* Standardises team names to:

  ```
  ADE, BRL, CAR, COL, ESS, FRE, GCS, GEE, GWS,
  HAW, MEL, NTH, PTA, RIC, STK, SYD, WBD, WCE
  ```

---

## **4. (Optional) Re-run `build_player_summary.py`**

If DFS data was refreshed or corrected.

---

## **5. `build_roundwise_projection.py` – Generate Round-by-Round Projections**

**Output Directory**

```
data/processed/
```

**Output File**

```
afl_fantasy_player_summary_2026.xlsx
```

**Inputs**

| File                              | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Positions2026withAvgs.xlsx`      | Master list of all 2026 players (DOB, price, averages) |
| `afl_fantasy_player_summary.xlsx` | Player vs opponent averages                            |
| `fixture_2026.xlsx`               | Round/Home/Away fixture                                |

**Purpose**

* Joins all three files.
* Produces **projected fantasy score for each player for every round**.
* This is the core projection output.

---

## **6. `build_player_ceiling.py` – Compute Ceiling Scores (Best 2 Scores)**

**Output File**

```
data/raw/afl_fantasy_player_summary_ceiling.xlsx
```

**Purpose**

* Similar to the average summary, **but uses best 2 scores vs each opponent**.
* Produces a more optimistic "ceiling" model.

---

## **7. `build_roundwise_ceiling.py` – Generate Ceiling Projections**

**Output Directory**

```
data/processed/
```

**Output File**

```
afl_fantasy_player_ceiling_2026.xlsx
```

**Inputs**

* `Positions2026withAvgs.xlsx`
* `afl_fantasy_player_summary_ceiling.xlsx`
* `fixture_2026.xlsx`

**Purpose**

* Generates a round-by-round ceiling projection.
* Useful for upside modelling & identifying breakout candidates.

# **📦 Final Output Files**

| File                                   | Location          | Description                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `afl_fantasy_player_summary_2026.xlsx` | `data/processed/` | Round-by-round projections (average-based) |
| `afl_fantasy_player_ceiling_2026.xlsx` | `data/processed/` | Round-by-round projections (ceiling-based) |

---

# **🧰 Technology Stack**

* **Python 3.x**
* `requests`
* `pandas`
* `openpyxl`
* `beautifulsoup4` (for scraping)
* `lxml`
* Excel I/O for all input/output

*No other languages are required — this is a Python-only project.*

---

# **📘 Notes**

* `Positions2026withAvgs.xlsx` is downloaded from Patreon; it is the **master player dataset**.
* Player DOB values should be cleaned to **DD/MM/YYYY only** (timestamps removed).
* From columns **ADE onward**, all projection values are rounded **up to the next integer**.

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ A **template repo structure**
✅ A **sample Python virtual environment + requirements.txt**
✅ A **GitHub Actions workflow** to automate the entire pipeline

Just let me know!
