Read 2026AflFantasyShortList.xlsx from data\raw

Build an optimal 30-player squad:

22 starters: 6 DEF, 8 MID, 2 RUC, 6 FWD

8 bench: 2 DEF, 3 MID, 1 RUC, 2 FWD

Salary cap: $17,800,000

Bench players don’t score; they are selected to be cheap “cash cows”

One captain (must be a starter) whose points are doubled

At least 4 different AFL teams represented in the squad (my interpretation of “team must have at least 4 options” – you can change this if needed)

Save output as 2026AflFantasyTeam.xlsx into data\processed

It also supports DPP (e.g. DEF/MID) if your Position column has slashes.
