Now I have xlsx files
for afl_fantasy_points_{season}_{Team} for seasons 2022 to 2025
in the folder C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\dfs
Example file afl_fantasy_points_2022_ADE
Output file Name: afl_fantasy_player_summary

I want to consolidate all the filesand create one summary file
which will have one record per player

Drop the columns BYE

The consolidate column will have average points scored by player against a opposite team.
The column heading will be avg, adj, avg(100), avg(120), avg(ppm) and team name (average against each team)
