summarise and create a Readme rich text document the steps we covered today
1. Execute fetch_dfs_data

OUTPUT_DIR = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\dfs"

Output file afl_results_{season}.xlsx, and afl_fantasy_points_{season}_{team}.xlsx
scrapes data from dfs australia site to get fixture/results and fantasy points for each player scored in each round

2. Execute build_player_summary
OUTPUT_FILE = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\raw\afl_fantasy_player_summary.xlsx"

Reads all files like afl_fantasy_points_*.xlsx" in C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\dfs"
and craetes a summary file for each player showing their average score against Each Team

3. Execute build_fixture_2026 to get current season fixture from footywire
OUTPUT_PATH = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\raw\fixture_2026.xlsx"

4. Execute build_player_summary 
OUTPUT_FILE = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\raw\afl_fantasy_player_summary.xlsx"

5. Execute build_roundwise_projection 
OUTPUT_DIR = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\processed"
OUTPUT_FILE = "afl_fantasy_player_summary_2026.xlsx"

Inputs :
POSITIONS_FILE = "Positions2026withAvgs.xlsx"            # master list of all players
SUMMARY_FILE = "afl_fantasy_player_summary.xlsx"         # per-player vs-opponent averages
FIXTURE_FILE = "fixture_2026.xlsx"                       # fixture with Round, Home, Away

InputDirectory
RAW_DIR = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\raw"

POSITIONS_FILE is downloaded from Patreon site which gives me all current players for the season, their date of birth, 
priced at, last 3 years average.

This becomes master list for all the next steps.
Join the  3 files and create afl_fantasy_player_summary_2026.xlsx
This will now have projected score for each round in the current seasonbased on the avg score against their opponents

6. Execute build_player_ceiling .
Output OUTPUT_FILE = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\raw\afl_fantasy_player_summary_ceiling.xlsx"
This is similar to build_player_summary, but instea dof average we take the avearge of thier 2 best score against the opponent.

7. Excute build_roundwise_ceiling.py. This is similar to  build_roundwise_projection. The only difference is it based on 
the avg of 2 best scores against the opponent. This is more optimistic.
RAW_DIR = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\raw"
OUTPUT_DIR = r"C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\processed"
OUTPUT_FILE = "afl_fantasy_player_ceiling_2026.xlsx"

POSITIONS_FILE = "Positions2026withAvgs.xlsx"            # master list of all players
SUMMARY_FILE = "afl_fantasy_player_summary_ceiling.xlsx"         # per-player vs-opponent averages
FIXTURE_FILE = "fixture_2026.xlsx"                       # fixture with Round, Home, Away
