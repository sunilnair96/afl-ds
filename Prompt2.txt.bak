Teams = ["ADE", "BRL", "CAR", "COL", "ESS", "FRE", "GCS", "GEE", "GWS", "HAW", "MEL", "NTH", "PTA", "RIC", "STK", "SYD", "WBD", "WCE"]

Visit https://dfsaustralia.com/afl-results/?season=2025

The season will be a variable initial value = 2025

This gives results of each game,

The Output I need is  in Round, Home, HomeScore, Away, AwayScore

Then for each team and each season get player stats

   url = f"https://dfsaustralia.com/afl-fantasy-points/?team={team}&season={season}"

From  this url i need the following table as output.
The columns 0 to 28 represents the round
The site provides the image of team. 
if you replace the image to Teams that will be nice.
Otherwise you can use the results page to understand who was the opponent for that team in that season for that round.
