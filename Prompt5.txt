Create a new Python code to do the following

The output file will be written to :
Ouput Directory:  C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\processed
Output file : afl_fantasy_player_summary_2026.xlsx

Input Directory : C:\Users\sunil\Projects\2026ws\afl-ds\data\raw
Input Files : Positions2026withAvgs  Sheet Positions 2025 with Avgs
Input files : afl_fantasy_player_summary
Input file : fixture_2026

The file Positions2026withAvgs is the master file which has all the players for 2026 Season

afl_fantasy_player_summary has avearges aginst opponent for each player based on thier last performance. This available in column name = team name

fixture_2026 gives the team and opponent

Join Positions2026withAvgs with afl_fantasy_player_summary.
keep all columns from Positions2026withAvgs 
Then add following columns avg	adj	avg(100)	avg(120)	avg(ppm) 
from afl_fantasy_player_summary
Then using Team column of Positions2026withAvgs get the Opponent for each round from fixture_2026.
Using this populate columns round 0 to round 24. 
if the team is not playing, then the value for that will be 0.
Based on the Opponent get the value from the Team Name in afl_fantasy_player_summary

I will atach the sample input files.
